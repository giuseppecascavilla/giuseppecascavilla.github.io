TO A HUMAN IT’S A FLASH DRIVE.

TO A COMPUTER IT’S A KEYBOARD, TYPING AT SUPERHUMAN SPEEDS.


Keystroke Injection
Computers trust humans. Humans use keyboards. Hence the universal spec — HID, or Human Interface Device.

A keyboard presents itself as a HID, and in turn it's inherently trusted as human by the computer.

The USB Rubber Ducky — which looks like an innocent flash drive to humans — abuses this trust to deliver powerful payloads, injecting keystrokes at superhuman speeds.
