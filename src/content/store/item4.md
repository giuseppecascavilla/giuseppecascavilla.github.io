2x ALFA Network card. Model ALFA awus036nha. 

Alfa AWUS036NHA is (personally) one of the best wireless adapters for WiFi hacking and pentesting, ever made by Alfa. It uses the Atheros AR9271 chipset, which means that it will be natively supported by most Linux distributions including Kali Linux. This WiFi adapter is compatible with any brand 802.11g or 802.11n router using 2.4 ghz wave-length and supports MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) with high speed transfer TX data rate up to 150 mbps.
