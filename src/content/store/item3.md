The <b>USB Rubber Ducky</b> or Bad USB is a famous attack tool that looks like a USB pen drive but acts like a keyboard when plugged into any unlocked device. It can be programmed to inject keystroke and binary files into a system, get the cached password to hack a system, steal the victim's essential and credential data, and can inject rubber ducky payload to the victim’s system. The most important feature of a USB Rubber Ducky is that it cannot be detected by any Anti-Virus or system Firewall as it acts as an HID device.

The cons of USB Rubber Ducky is that it is <b>expansive</b>. 

The Digispark is an ATtiny 85-based microcontroller development board, programmable in Arduino coming with a price of €9

Digispark boards can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. ATtiny85 has about 8 kB of programmable flash memory. The bootloader uses about 2 kB and the available memory will be 6 kB. It is very small compared to an Arduino board or Rubber Ducky equipment, but if we limit our payload size to around 6 kB, it is sufficient.

With a Digispark board you have your cheap USB Rubber Ducky and you can use it to test your payloads and attacks.
