I bought a Nexus 5 on eBay for â‚¬40. It runs a full Kali distro (with some limitations), it can do HID attacks, packet injection for wifi hacking, it has a camera, LTE capabilities, cold boot attacks through DriveDroid, and a built-in monitor.

To me, this is one of the most amazing devices out there for the price.

Kali NetHunter is an Android ROM made for security researchers and hackers. Offensive Security, the team behind Kali Linux, makes it. If you ever wanted to do hacking on your phone, NetHunter is the best thing, other than Termux.
