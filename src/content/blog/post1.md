Here we are! Yet another blog... again on cybersecurity, darkweb, and some other sh*t!!
Why this website? Why this blog? </br>

Well, it was time to dismiss my old Google website (still available). Dated 2014, when I embarked upon my Ph.D., to have a digital presence on the web. 
For this reason, I opted for a fresh start, a fresh website, and fresh content. Here is this new website! </b>

Now, the question is: What is this website about? Well... I do not know! </b>

First of all, I want to continue having a web presence where I can share my research and let the globe know me and what I do.
However, this web space might also be a chance to share and discuss some findings from my research. And if you had the time to browse around 
you should know that my research revolves around cybersecurity, the dark web, the Open Source INTelligence, and more in general the research of new approaches and tools to fight cybercrime. </b>

The idea is to use this space, channel, and megaphone to discuss about dark web and criminal activities. Try to investigate new approaches and highlight cybercrime trends. 
Probably it will no be the only subject of this blog. This space will also be used to share personal thoughts, achievements, travels, pictures, and videos. </b>

For the moment, that's it from my side. </b>

See you soon!!!
