        <p class="text-lg">
            This project was an assignment for the Data Forensics course (JM2040-M-6) at JADS for the master Data Science in Business and Entrepreneurship.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">The project</h2>
            <p class="text-lg">For this project we analyzed data we gathered from the Cocorico Marketplace that can be
                found on the Dark Web.
                The goal of this project is to provide insights in the drugs that are being sold on the marketplace and
                to provide a better understanding of drug sales on the Dark Web.
                We hope to find patterns in the data that can help Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in their fight
                against drug trafficking.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Methodology</h2>
            <p class="text-lg"> To gather our data we used a crawler and two scrapers: one to gather product data
                and one to gather data on the categories. After scraping, the data was processed and
                analysed in Python using the Pandas and Regex libraries. The data was then visualized using
                Matplotlib and Seaborn.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Crawling</h3>
                <p class="text-lg"> For 35 days, we crawled the Cocorico Marketplace and gathered data on the products
                    that were being sold.
                    We collected data on the different drug categories and the individual products. The product data
                    includes the price, availability, number of views, seller and its rating. We only crawled
                    drug-related pages by analysing the URL structure and filtering out non-drug related pages.
                    
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Scraping</h3>
                <p class="text-lg"> We created two scrapers: one to gather product data and one to gather data on the
                    categories. The scrapers were written in Python using the BeautifulSoup library and looped through
                    all the crawled files.
                    The product scraper collected data on the individual products, including the price, availability,
                    number of views, seller and its rating.
                    The category scraper collected data on the different drug categories and the number of products in
                    each category.
